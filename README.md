# Project Title : STORE SALES PREDICTION
# Technologies : Machine Learning Technology
# Domain : Sales And Marketing

## Problem Statement:
### -> Nowadays, shopping mails and Big Marts keep track of individual items sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and patterns can be discovered.

## Approach
### -> The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that's best fit for the above case.

## Dataset
### -> We have train(8523) and test(5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variables.
### We need to predict the sales for test data set on data as follow.

### Features:
### Item_weight : Weight of product
### Item_Fat_Content : Whether the product is low fat or not
### Item_Visibility : The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to a particular product.
### Item_Type : The category to which the product belongs
### Item_MRP : Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
### Outlet_Identifier : Unique Store ID
### Outlet_Establishment_Year : The year in which store was established
### Outlet_Size : The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
### Outlet_Location_Type : The type of city in which the store is located
### Outlet_Type : Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket

### Target:
### Item_Outlet_Sales : Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.
